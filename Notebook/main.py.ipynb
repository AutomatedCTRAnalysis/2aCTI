Use of DLL Hijacking technique to execute the payload , a technique that they have use in the past . figure 1 : old sample on the left side , our sample on the right side figure 2 : old sample on the left side , our sample on the right side figure 3 : old sample on the left side , our sample on the right side technical overview base on our research and investigation of the compromise machine , we be able to find two sample which seem to be in development and contain code from some old HttpBrowser sample . both sample share a lot of code but one of they have more functionality . the execution start when a malicious sfx file be execute . the follow file be include in the executable : INISafeWebSSO.exe \\xe2\\x80\\x93 legitimate file which will load the malicious DLL inicore_v2.3.30.dll \\xe2\\x80\\x93 malicious DLL sys.bin.url \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the name of both malicious payload we find in order to execute the payload , the attacker take advantage of a technique call DLL Search Order Hijacking . once the malicious DLL be load , it will decrypt a part of its own code use a XOR loop ( see Figure 4 ) , patch the entry point of the legitimate executable and jump again , back to the malicious DLL ( see Figure 5 ) . figure 4 : first XOR decryption loop figure 5 : patched entry point after jump back to the DLL , it will repeat the same process to decrypt a part of itself and find the address of LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress to load all the necessary function dynamically . lastly , it will read the sys.bin.url file and the execution will transfer to it . once this be do , it will xor decrypt the rest of the malicious payload and decompress it use RtlDecompressBuffer . Payload we will focus on the payload with the additional functionality ( we will describe the difference between the two sample we find later ) . enter the payload , we can see some interesting string which seem to be use for debug purpose ( see Figure 6 and Figure 7 ) . this be one of the reason we believe that the tool be still in development . figure 6 : debug string Figure 7 : debug string the action take be base on the number of pass parameter . they be summarise in the follow table and describe below . option 0 - Terminate / delete itself , WMI execution when the binary be execute for the first time : it will check if it run from the % TEMP% folder , if it do , it will attempt to kill its own process . if it run from the % APPDATA% folder it will spawn a new svchost process with -k as a parameter and it will inject the sys.bin.url to it . otherwise , it will create a new directory with the name systemconfig under % appdata% , move all the three file ( executable , DLL , sys.bin.url ) into it , and will execute the binary from the create directory use WMI . option one \\xe2\\x80\\x93 svchost injection where the number of pass parameter be one , the payload will read the sys.bin.url file from % appdata%\\\\systemconfig . it will then spawn a new svchost process as c:\\\\\\\\windows\\\\\\\\system32\\\\\\\\svchost.exe \\xe2\\x80\\x93k update in suspend state and inject the payload . finally , it patch the entry point of svchost.exe so it can execute the malicious payload after the ResumeThread call . option two \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Persistence & svchost injection again the method of persistence depend on the access right . if the payload\\xe2\\x80\\x99s process be run from a user with admin right then it will create a new service . the service name will be take from the config , in our case the name be systemconfig with \\xe2\\x80\\x98for system config\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as the description of the service . the binary path will be the extract installer path along with /update as a parameter . otherwise , it will add the binary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s path to the Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run key with \\xe2\\x80\\x94update as a parameter . if the persistence be do by this method , or not at all , then it will inject into svchost as describe in the option one section . option three \\xe2\\x80\\x93 core functionality this be describe in detail below in the Core Functionality section . option four \\xe2\\x80\\x93 UAC Bypass an already public UAC bypass method be include in the binary . it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 t matter if the method will work or not since the process will exit . this be one more indication that the tool be still in development and there be plan to expand its capability . core functionality currently , the core functionality include write the configuration to registry and communicate with the C&C server . we do not find any malicious functionality such as upload or download file , or execute attacker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s command . config each value of the config be write to the registry after encrypt they use the DES algorithm . a new registry key be create under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Classes\\\\ use either the SystemProductName value from the hardware\\\\description\\\\system\\\\bio key or the hardcoded string \\xe2\\x80\\x9c68A - D3H - b1111 as a name . additionally , a hardcoded string -hjdwr6vsjqfyb89mxxxx be append to the name . for example : VMware Virtual Service - HjDWr6vsJqfYb89mxxxx or z68a - D3H - b1111 - HjDWr6vsJqfYb89mxxxx the key and the IV use in the encryption be base on the first eight byte of this registry key\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name , for example , VMware V. the encrypted sub - key be describe below . the majority of these sub - key will not be read from the payload once they have be write . this might suggest that there be plan to expand the functionality of the tool . we write a Python script to automate the identification of the registry key and decryption of the sub - key value [ 1 ] . a summary of the decrypt value can be find in the following table : key name Description key value in sample one key value in sample two Bin Payload file\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name sys.bin.url sys.bin.url Console N / a helen galway dll Hijacked DLL use to run the payload inicore_v2.3.30.dll inicore_v2.3.30.dll group N / A Default Default GUID Unique GUID generate use CoCreateGuid a unique GUID a unique GUID MD5 N / A HjDWr6vsJqfYb89mxxxx HjDWr6vsJqfYb89mxxxx OnlineHelp Stores the C&C IP . 103.59.144.183:443 , 159.65.80.157:443 Path Path for Associated Files c:\\\\programdata\\\\systemconfig\\\\ c:\\\\programdata\\\\systemconfig\\\\ pe legitimate executable which will load the DLL file .
